# Nothing But Nice Guild Charter

## Mission Statement:

Clearing content with good vibes and a positive environment is what we are striving for at Nothing But Nice and is our primary objective. Character matters first and foremost here and getting the right person is a more important aspect to our guild. Loot comes and goes but a strong sense of community and friendship outlasts any game and is the core foundation of what we are trying to establish. We want to be a place of diversity for any kind of player who is willing to put forward an effort to become better and maintain a positive attitude. Between the more experienced veterans of EQ and the new player experiencing a TLP for the first time, harboring an environment of learning and moving forward together will maintain a strong guild foundation and great experiences for years to come.

## Code of Conduct

Here at Nothing But Nice we expect just that in your interactions with your guildmates. Our community expands beyond multiple servers and games. We are all adults and expect you to act as such. While we expect there to be no internal issues if one arises please take it to tells or a private discord channel. While we are a very relaxed environment, the only thing we ask is that you keep your racial, homophobic and sexist comments to yourself. Discussion of RMT in the guild discord and in guild chat will not be tolerated. Overall, guildmates are expected to help each other and play with each other.

## Leadership Approach:
The Nothing But Nice community has worked together across multiple servers and multiple games. As such we have found ruling by council is the most effective way to go. Our Guild leader and officers work hand and hand on policy. Nothing is absolute and we are always welcome to constructive criticism to the leadership team. While we do our best in our delivery of information to the team, we expect the same in return.
