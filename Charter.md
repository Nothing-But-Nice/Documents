# Nothing But Nice Guild Charter

## Mission Statement:

Our primary objective at Nothing but Nice is to effectively clear content with good vibes and a positive environment. Loot comes and goes but a strong sense of community and friendship outlasts any game and is the core foundation we are trying to establish. We want to be a place of diversity for any kind of player who is willing to put forward an effort to become better and maintain a positive attitude. Between the more experienced veterans of EQ and the new player experiencing a TLP for the first time, harboring an environment of learning and moving forward together will maintain a strong guild foundation and great experiences for years to come.

## Code of Conduct

Here at Nothing But Nice we expect exactly  that in your interactions with your guildmates. Our community expands beyond multiple servers and games. We are all adults and expect everyone  to act as such. While we expect there to be no internal issues, if one does arise please take it to tells or a private discord channel. We ask is that you keep any political, racial, homophobic or sexist comments to yourself. RMT will not be tolerated. Overall, guildmates are expected to help each other and respect each other.

## Leadership Approach:
The Nothing But Nice community has worked together across multiple servers and multiple games. As such, we have found leading by council is the most effective way to go. Our Guild leader and officers work hand and hand on policy. Nothing is absolute and we always welcome constructive criticism to the leadership team. While we do our best in our delivery of information to the team, we expect the same in return. 

## Aradune Goals
As a guild we understand the TLP life cycle and time commitment from players. While we aspire to make it as far as possible our leadership team is committed to the immediate short term goal of Planes of Power completion and long term goal of Omens of War. From there we will monitor guild health, player commitment and server landscape for future milestones.
