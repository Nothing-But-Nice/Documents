# NOTHING BUT NICE DKP SYSTEM

NBN DKP is a structured, closed bid style system. It is a culmination of ideas found over several iterations of TLP servers meant to further our guild's atmosphere and goals while allowing for a fair distribution of raid items with some oversight. 

## DKP AT A GLANCE

This is an inflationary system where values are based on BRV (Base Raid Value). BRV is the amount of DKP you earn per raid tick. BRV amount will be increased each expansion in place of decaying current dkp. 

Raid ticks will be taken at the start, every 30 minutes and the end of a raid on a sanctioned raid night. x1 BRV is given every raid tick. DKP will only be given for raids during normal raid days with the exception of expansion launches. This will be posted in advance. 


BRV (DKP Earned Per Tick) | 2
--|--
&nbsp; | DKP Values
**Minimum Bid** | 20
**Max Main Bid** | 250
**Max Bid If <40% RA** | 30
**Expansion DKP Cap** | 500

### Important Notes:
* <40% 30-Day RA FM: Max Bid is equal to 15x BRV
* <10% 30-Day RA FM: Bids as an applicant
* Applicants may bid min bid. They cannot outbid or win over a main member with higher than 10% RA. Currently Alts & FnF may not bid.

## WHERE DO I SUBMIT BIDS?
https://nbn.opendkp.com/#/bid - All bids will be submitted via the web tool. These are NOT viewable by anyone, even the officers, until the bids are exposed to everyone. Once the auction is over every bid will be viewable. In the event the bid tool is unavailable (it is hosted through AWS) bids will be taken by senior officers. We do not expect this to happen often, if ever.

* **Important that all members are registered, if not registered - cannot bid. Make sure the character is claimed when registered.** 

## WHAT HAPPENS DURING AND AFTER THE BIDDING PERIOD?
1. Bids are placed and may be changed until auction ends.
2. Auction ends and all bids are displayed.
3. Winner pays +1 over the second highest bid. If a tie bid winner of the tie pays bid amount. 

### Examples below: 

Example One:
```
Barudin 	Bids 20
Tanadien 	Bids 30

Tana wins and pays 21 DKP.
```

Example Two:
```
Barudin 	bids 20
Tanadien 	bids 30
Swan 		bids 30 

Swan wins the tie due to higher attendance. Swan pays 30 DKP.
```

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NO ONE BIDS ON AN ITEM?
Any item that is not bid upon will be rolled to all toons present in the raid. You may roll on (1) character as “need” to win and receive the item for free. It does not matter if this toon is an Alt, Main, FnF or Recruit. 

If you loot an item you cannot use you will be charged x55 BRV. On raids, auto-loot no drop should be off and you should confirm your loot before accepting.

## WHAT HAPPENS ON TIE BIDS?
Tie items will be handed out based upon (60) day attendance. If those are a tie, refer to (30) day and then (90) day. If all those match the item will be randomed via lifetime attendance ticks.

## CLASS AND SPECIAL ITEMS
Special high value items, Class items and/or tradeable items such as Blade of Carnage will be officer awarded for minimum bid. This list will be posted before the expansion though may be updated at any time. This does not apply to Trak BP or VS Legs.

Items that are awarded for keying (such as Sleeper’s Tomb, etc) and Epic quest items are outside of the DKP system and will be awarded at officer discretion.

## GOING NEGATIVE
Your DKP is what is posted on the website at raid start. It is up to the individual member to be responsible for the following. (1) Knowing if you are above 40% attendance to bid appropriately. If you win an item outside of this the minimum penalty is double the item cost  (Please note - DKP System should prevent members > 40% from bidding beyond the threshold set). (2) Not going negative. If you go negative the fee is x50 BRV at a minimum. Repeat offenders will be subject to guild removal.

## EXTENDED ABSENCES
Real life should always take priority over EQ. If you know you are going to be mia for an extended amount of time please inform the officer team via a PM on discord to avoid dkp wipes.

## DKP Removals for Extended Absences:

### With Notice: 
DKP will not be wiped upon extended absence if notice is given via discord PM to the senior officer team. We understand and agree that real life is more important than EQ. We just ask you to give us a heads up. 

### No Notice: 
50% of DKP wiped after 30 days. 

100% of DKP wiped after 60 days. 

## MAIN CHANGES
We understand people may want to change classes to keep the game enjoyable. We are willing to accommodate a wide host of class changes as long as the officers feel you are not abusing the system. Just ask, we are always willing to have that conversation. Very rarely, if at all will an unapproved main change penalty be given after a conversation with the officer team.

Main Change Type | DKP Cost
--|--
Officer Requested Main Change Penalty | 0 DKP (Kunark)
Approved Main Change Penalty | 150 DKP (Kunark)
Unapproved Main Change Penalty |300 DKP (Kunark)

### Unapproved:
* 80% DKP Charge or 150x BRV whichever is higher no exceptions. Officer's decision if a new app is required.

### Approved:
* Main Change - Charge of 75x BRV no exceptions. Full membership retained.

### Officer Requested:
* No DKP Penalty, Full membership retained.

**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH DKP TO COVER THE BRV CHARGE YOU WILL GO NEGATIVE.**

## BONUS DKP
Bonus DKP will be given for special occurrences or at officer discretion. Each bonus may not exceed 5x BRV with the exception of the below.  

Special bonuses of up to x10 BRV may be given for first kills. x15 BRV will be given for expansion final boss clears or special bosses and encounters. 

## EXPANSION (OR MONTHLY) DKP CAP
DKP will be reduced to the current expansion cap at the end of the expansion. DKP granted via special bonuses on discord (not in raid bonuses) will be retained above the cap. For example a DKP incentivized item think (Aid Grimel) Signet of Might or Signet of the Arcane in Planes of Power. These bonuses will be posted in Discord when applicable.

## Second Main/PALT Policy
At this time there is no intention to have any kind of Second Main or PALT policy. We intend on growing to around 60+ mains in an effort to alleviate the need to box heavily on raids. As we move forward this will be evaluated based upon guild health and performance.

## GENERAL STATEMENTS AND FAQ
* The intention of this system is to allow our casual. fun atmosphere on raids to continue. If this system interrupts that we will address the rules accordingly.
* If the system is being abused the rules will be changed to address this. Individual members may be counseled by officers as well. The goal of this system is for the guild to be successful and not to screw over your own guildmates. We do not expect this to be an issue. 
* DKP Penalties may be given out for general non-compliance or intentional harm caused to the raid. We do not expect this to be an issue
* These rules are a guideline. If a situation arises that does not fit this mold two things will happen. An officer ruling will remedy the situation and the rules will be changed to accommodate the issue.
* If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to PM **Barudin**, **Lvya** or **Swan**.


# A SPECIAL THANKS!
I wanted to thank all of the contributions from various guilds DKP systems that went into making this one. A special thanks to Moncs for changing opendkp to accommodate closed bids. A thank you to IV2 of Coirnav and OGC of Phinigel for contributing heavily to this system. As well as a sincere thank you to the officers, dkp admin and members whose feedback has helped shape this system into what it is

# TL;DR
* DKP is earned every ½ hour. 
* BRV is the DKP earned per raid tick. For Kunark you earn 2 per tick.
* Everyone bids through https://nbn.opendkp.com/#/bid
* Whoever wins the bid pays +1 over the second highest bid. In the event of a tie you pay the bid amount
* All bids are shown after bidding period has ended
